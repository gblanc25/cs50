# Gabe's Tips For Success in CS50

Welcome to CS50! The course can definitely be challenging at times, especially if (like me last year) you've never taken a CS course before. 

Fortunately, the course has a ton of support structures in place to help you, which I've compiled as a list of my best tips for success in CS50:

**1. Go to tutorials!!** We (the TFs and CAs) love to help you and are here for you! These are the best ways (**emphasis on best**) to get one-on-one support in the course, especially if you want in-depth explanations of course content or debugging help. Sign up for as many as you'd like each week.

**2. On that note, start psets early.** That way you can attend the less busy tutorials early on, and feel less stressed when Sunday rolls around!

**3. Go to office hours!** Office hours are in Widener on Sundays from 3-5. All 80+ staff members are there to help you, but things can definitely get a bit busy and stressful since psets are due Sunday night. Best to get as much of your pset done as you can before then!

**4. Save your extension, if you can.** Pset 9 is very intensive, and odds are your other classes will be taking up more time by this point too. You may want to save your extension for later in the course!

**5. Go to lab.** Yes, labs are optional (though strongly encouraged), but they'll walk you through the lab assignments you have to submit and prepare you well for the pset each week!

**6. Watch the walkthrough videos.** Very helpful in terms of planning out pseudocode and introducing important syntax!

**7. Get ARC Academic tutoring if wanted.** You can get 2 free hours of tutoring per week at the Academic Resource Center!

**8. Above all, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything,** whether that be me or any of the course heads!

Best of luck this semester :)
