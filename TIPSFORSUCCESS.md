# Gabe's Tips For Success in CS50

Welcome to CS50! The course can definitely be challenging, especially if (like me when I took CS50) you've never taken a CS course before. 

Fortunately, the course has a ton of support structures in place to help you, which I've compiled as a list of my best tips for success in CS50:

**1. Go to TF/CA office hours!!** We love to help you and are here for you! These are the best ways (**emphasis on best**) to get one-on-one support in the course, especially if you want in-depth explanations of course content or debugging help. Sign up for as many as you'd like each week.

**2. On that note, start psets early.** That way you can attend the less busy office hours early on, and feel less stressed when Sunday rolls around!

**3. Post questions on Ed.** Ed is a great place to get asynchronous online help - post a public or private question and staff or other students will respond and help you out! (New this year: the AI CS50 Duck will give you an immediate response. You can also chat with the duck at [cs50.ai](https://cs50.ai/))

**4. Go to Widener office hours.** Office hours are in Widener on Sundays from 3-5. All staff members are there to help you, but things can definitely get a bit busy and stressful since psets are due Sunday night. Best to get as much of your pset done as you can before then!

**5. Watch the walkthrough videos!** These videos - thanks to Brian Yu - offer detailed walkthroughs of each pset and will often give you some starter code to help you out. Best to watch before going to office hours!

**6. Save your late hours, if you can.** Some weeks - especially 4 and 9 - are very intensive, and odds are your other classes will be taking up more time later in the semester too. You may want to save your late hours for later in the course - but by all means, if you need to use them, use them. 

**7. Get ARC Academic tutoring if wanted.** You can get 2 free hours of tutoring per week at the Academic Resource Center. 

**8. Above all, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything,** whether that be me or any of the course heads!

Best of luck this semester :)
