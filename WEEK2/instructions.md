Our labs each week are structured as follows:

1. Complete lab, step by step, in small groups (we'll review as a class after each step)! The lab can be accessed via the CS50 course website.
2. Student Questions
3. Additional exercises done in groups / as a class. Even if we don't get to these in lab, you're welcome to try them on your own! Check in each week's folder on this website for the files labeled with *week#_extrapractice_filename*. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions!
